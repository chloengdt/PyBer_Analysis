### Based on the line graph, we can conclude:
- Urban cities: fares are highest in the beginning of the month and lower at the end of the month. Fares are highest in March and very flutuated. 
- Suburban cities: fares less fluctuated by time of the month, however, the peak price of fares are in March. 
- Rural cities: fares changes more frequently by the time of the month but less dramatic than other city types. 

## Summary 
### Conclusion:  
  Urban cities have the highest demand on ride shares and generate the highest revenue. However, the drivers get the lowest rate due to the high number of drivers. Rural cities have the lowest demand for ride shares and generate the lowest revenue. However, the drives get the highest rate since there are fewer drivers. 
### Recomendations: 
- Focus on expand ride share service in Urban cities since there are high demand and high employee resouces. 
- Not recomend to invest in rural cities since there are low demand and less drives, the cost is high and revenue is low. 
- Can consider increase the ride share in March and begining of each month since the demand trends are at peak at those timeframes and reduce the number of hiring drivers at the end of the month since the demands are low to save the cost.
